# AI for Collective Intelligence (AI4CI)
A UKRI AI Research Hub

## Our Vision
To address society’s most pressing challenges we must be able to reliably engineer important new kinds of Collective Intelligence:

“Connected communities of people, devices, data and software collaboratively sensing and interacting in real-time to achieve positive outcomes at multiple scales”.

New AI methods and technologies are central to meeting this challenge.

The AI4CI Hub combines AI expertise with excellence in key application domains in a strongly integrated national consortium of leading UK universities working with dozens of non-academic partners from across government, industry and civil society.

## Developing new AI for Smart Collectives:

* minimising the impact of the next global pandemic
* preventing financial instability
* encouraging sustainable and liveable cities
* combating social polarisation and disinformation on social media
* integrating clinical care and social support for patients with diabetes
